# Hypha

## Goals

### Democratize Large-Scale ML

Make cutting-edge machine learning accessible to organizations by efficiently utilizing heterogeneous compute resources.

### Minimize Operational Complexity

Develop a _self_-managing system that automatically handles resource discovery, workload distribution, fault tolerance, and scaling with minimal configuration requirements and administrative overhead.

### Power Production Applications

Provide a reliable, high-performance inference backbone to support real-world ML applications with the scale, latency, and reliability requirements of production systems.

### Real-World Ready

Build a secure, maintainable, and observable system that meets enterprise requirements for encryption, resilience, repeatable deployment, and comprehensive logging.

## Components
